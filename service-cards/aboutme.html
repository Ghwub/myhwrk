          I’m Melanie, a final-year Computer Science student passionate about blending creative design with technical polish.
          My journey has been shaped by curiosity, resilience, and a love for building digital experiences that feel both bold and seamless.

          With a focus on UI/UX and advanced CSS techniques, I enjoy transforming ideas into visually consistent, responsive layouts.
          Beyond coding, I thrive on creative direction — orchestrating unified branding through color, typography, and layout.

          My current goal is to complete my internship while polishing my portfolio, ensuring every section connects seamlessly
          with gradients, frosted glass effects, and responsive design. It’s not just about functionality — it’s about impact.
